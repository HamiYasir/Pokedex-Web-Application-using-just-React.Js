# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is a web app for implementing a Pokédex Web Application that will list all 151 original pokémon from fire red/ leaf green. I am developing this project to build my grasp on React.Js.

This project is done as part of Smolijames 8hrs React.Js Tutorial and is the second one out of the three projects that I will be developing for this course.

## THINGS I WILL BE LEARNING FROM THIS PROJECT:

-Working with APIs  
-Caching external information so that PokeAPI servers don't get DDOSed
